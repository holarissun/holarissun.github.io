🚀 I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, supervised by <a href="https://www.vanderschaar-lab.com/prof-mihaela-van-der-schaar/">Prof. Mihaela van der Schaar</a>. During my M.Phil. study at MMLab@CUHK, I was advised by <a href="http://dahua.me/">Prof. Dahua Lin</a> and <a href="http://bzhou.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/">Prof. Bolei Zhou</a>; I received my BSc in Physics from the Yuanpei Honor Program, at Peking University, and a BSc from the Guanghua School of Management, at Peking University. My undergrad thesis was advised by <a href="https://zhouchenlin.github.io/">Prof. Zhouchen Lin</a>.
I worked as an RA at the LCDM group@UIUC.

🤖️ I believe **Reinforcement Learning** is a vital part of the solution for AGI. My previous work on deep reinforcement learning is motivated by practical applications like robotics, healthcare, finance, and large language models. My research keywords during the past 4 years include:
- RL via Supervised Learning (2020-); Goal-Conditioned RL (2020-)
- Value-Based DRL (2021-); Offline RL (2021-); Optimism in Exploration (2021-); 
- **Uncertainty Quantification** (2022-); **Data-Centric Off-Policy Evaluation** (2022-); 
- **Interpretable RL**(2023-); **RL in Language Models.** (2023-)

🤝 I'm open to potential collaborations. Please kindly drop me an email for a chat. And let us push RL closer to genuine general intelligence.

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge. -->

🚀 **Hi there!** I am Hao Sun, a final-year Ph.D. student at the University of Cambridge, supervised by <a href="https://www.vanderschaar-lab.com/prof-mihaela-van-der-schaar/" style="color: gray; text-decoration: none;">Prof. Mihaela van der Schaar</a>, working at the intersection of reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs). During my M.Phil. study at <a href="https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/" style="color: gray; text-decoration: none;">MMLab@CUHK</a>, I was advised by <a href="http://dahua.site/" style="color: gray; text-decoration: none;">Prof. Dahua Lin</a> and <a href="https://boleizhou.github.io/" style="color: gray; text-decoration: none;">Prof. Bolei Zhou</a>. I hold a B.Sc. in Physics from the Yuanpei College at Peking University, and a B.Sc. from the Guanghua School of Management. My undergraduate thesis was supervised by <a href="https://zhouchenlin.github.io/" style="color: gray; text-decoration: none;">Prof. Zhouchen Lin</a>.

### <mark> I am seeking full-time research positions starting in 2025</mark>

Research
====
_**High-level research interests and motivations:**_ My research focuses on RL and LLM Alignment (also known as post-training). RL (and interacting with the environment) is the key toward super-human intelligence, and more powerful LLMs --- using RL as training framework and natural language as the interaction interface --- can significantly enhance the ability of humans to learn from machine intelligence. 

## Representative Works

**I am particularly proud of the following research works.** <br>

### - Large Langauge Model Alignment (Since 2023)
- **[Query-Dependent Prompt Evaluation and Optimization with Offline Inverse RL](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06553)**  
  *ICLR 2024, also NeurIPS 2023 ENLSP Workshop as **<span style="background-color: #f0f0f0; color: #333;">Oral</span>** Presentation*  
  **Hao Sun**, Alihan Hüyük, jMihaela van der Schaar  
    - We studied the large language model inference-time optimization on mathematical reasoning tasks.
    - We highlighted the importance of reward models in **<span style="background-color: #f0f0f0; color: #333;">LLM inference-time optimization for math</span>**, which has been recognized by the community as an important topic since late 2024 (a year after the paper has been finished).

- **[Rethinking the Bradley-Terry Models in Preference-based Reward Modeling: Foundation, Theory, and its Alternatives](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04991)**  
  *ICLR 2025 **<span style="background-color: #f0f0f0; color: #333;">Oral (Top 1.2%)</span>***  
  **Hao Sun<sup>*</sup>**, Yunyi Shen<sup>*</sup>, Jean-Francois Ton ( &ast; denotes equal contribution)  
    - We studied the foundation of preference-based reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) practices, answering the foundational question of why the Bradley-Terry model is a solid choice in RLHF.
    - **<span style="background-color: #f0f0f0; color: #333;">We justified and poineered the research direction of embedding-based reward modeling.</span>**
    - Our follow-up works further developed this agenda by studying active reward modeling in RLHF, efficient personalized alignment, and contributing computationally-efficient infrastructure to the research community.

### - Reinforcement Learning (Since 2018)
- **[Policy Continuation with Hindsight Inverse Dynamics](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/3891b14b5d8cce2fdd8dcdb4ded28f6d-Paper.pdf)**  
  *NeurIPS 2019 **<span style="background-color: #f0f0f0; color: #333;">Spotlight (Top 2.4%)</span>***  
  **Hao Sun**, Zhizhong Li, Dahua Lin, Bolei Zhou  
    - We innovated the first self-imitation-learning paradigm of multi-goal RL.
    - Our paper **<span style="background-color: #f0f0f0; color: #333;">pioneered the research field of supervised-learning-based goal-conditioned RL</span>**, and has been followed by the research works from [UC Berkeley Paper 1](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxoqJrtvr) [and Paper 2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08909) since 2021.
    - Our [follow-up work](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=R9jakCHb_1C) extended this idea into general continuous control settings.
    - Our [follow-up work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.04478) published at ICLR 2022 connects this idea with offline-RL

- **[Exploiting Reward Shifting in Value-based Deep RL](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=iCxRsZcVVAH)**  
  *NeurIPS 2022*  
  **Hao Sun**, Lei Han, Rui Yang, Xiaoteng Ma, Bolei Zhou  
    - We added **<span style="background-color: #f0f0f0; color: #333;">new insights to the fundamental dilemma of exploration and exploitation trade-offs</span>** through reward shifting.
    - This line of research has been followed by [research from Professor Richard Sutton's group](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.09999) since 2024.
    - This method has been widely verified in RL applications such as <a href="https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2023/0514.pdf" style="color: gray; text-decoration: none;">offline RL (ICJAI'23))</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10801909" style="color: gray; text-decoration: none;">robotics locomotion (IROS'24)</a>, <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=AS0S1flXxR" style="color: gray; text-decoration: none;">optimistic initialization (AAMAS'24)</a> , <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11099" style="color: gray; text-decoration: none;">multi-agent exploration (Recent preprint)</a>.

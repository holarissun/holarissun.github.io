I am now a first-year PhD student at the University of Cambridge, supervised by <a href="https://www.vanderschaar-lab.com/prof-mihaela-van-der-schaar/">Prof. Mihaela van der Schaar</a>. Previously I received my M.Phil. degree from MMLab@CUHK, advised by <a href="http://dahua.me/">Prof. Dahua Lin</a> and <a href="http://bzhou.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/">Prof. Bolei Zhou</a>; and received my Bachelor of Science degree from Yuanpei Honor Program, Peking University. I finished all compulsory courses in Physics and Data Science. I also got a double degree in Management from Guanghua School, Peking University. I was a research assistant at the LCDM group@UIUC advised [Prof. Robert J. Brunner]("https://ece.illinois.edu/directory/profile/bigdog).

My research passion lies in **reinforcement learning**. I believe reinforcement learning provides a natural approach to intelligence.
I've researched on sample-efficient model-free DRL, goal-conditioned RL, safe-RL, offline-RL, robotics control, uncertainty quantification, and quantitative trading (A/H/Crypto).

======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge. -->

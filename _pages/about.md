I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, supervised by <a href="https://www.vanderschaar-lab.com/prof-mihaela-van-der-schaar/">Prof. Mihaela van der Schaar</a>. Previously I received my M.Phil. degree from MMLab@CUHK, advised by <a href="http://dahua.me/">Prof. Dahua Lin</a> and <a href="http://bzhou.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/">Prof. Bolei Zhou</a>; I received my Bachelor of Science degree from Yuanpei Honor Program, Peking University. I also got a double degree in Management from Guanghua School, Peking University. I was a research assistant at the LCDM group@UIUC.

I believe **Reinforcement Learning** is a vital part of the solution for AGI. My previous work on deep reinforcement learning is motivated by practical applications like robotics, healthcare, finance, and large language models. My research keywords during the past 4 years include:
- RL via Supervised Learning (2020-); Goal-Conditioned RL (2020-)
- Value-Based DRL (2021-); Offline RL (2021-); Optimism in Exploration (2021-); 
- **Uncertainty Quantification** (2022-); **Data-Centric Off-Policy Evaluation** (2022-); 
- **Interpretable RL**(2023-); **RL in Language Models.** (2023-)

_**I'm looking for internships for summer 2024, please drop me an email if you find my research interesting. I'm also open to collaborationsü§ù.**_

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge. -->
